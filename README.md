# Project overview

This software engineering project is a real-time air traffic simulator designed to automatically model and manage aircraft movement and airport operations. It simulates complex scenarios including multiple flights, real-time flight trajectories, collision risk management, and unforeseen events such as aviation emergencies.

# Key Features
* Simulation visualization
Real-time display of date and time to follow the progress of the simulation.
2. Airport Monitoring
Visualization of airports, display of their data: name, total number of runways, planes ready to take off.
3. Aircraft Tracking
Visualization of aircraft in flight with their key information (altitude, speed, distance traveled, departure and arrival airports, departure/arrival times).
4. Airplane Trajectories in Real Time
Real-time trajectory displayed with a solid line for the completed route and a dotted line for the remaining route.
5. Adjustable Simulation Speed
Ability to increase or decrease the speed of the simulation.
6. Collision Detection and Avoidance
Automatic collision risk management: reduction of an aircraft's speed to avoid an accident.
7. Generation of Emergency Events
Rare events such as breakdowns or medical emergencies may occur, resulting in an emergency landing.

# How It Works 

![Application screenshot 2](https://github.com/ericbeaubrun/portfolio/blob/master/public/resources/projects/aerien2.gif)

1. Background: Displays a map showing airports and airplanes in flight.
2. Trajectory: Shows the flight paths of the planes.
3. Grid: Toggles the map's grid view.
4. Relief: Click the "Relief" button to display geographical features such as mountains and elevations on the map.
5. Pause: Click the pause button to stop the simulation.
6. Resume: Click the pause button again to resume the simulation.
7. Speed Adjustment: Use the "speed +" and "speed -" buttons to adjust the speed of the simulation.
8. Data Visualization:
9. Airports: Click on an airport to view its data, including its name, number of runways, and the number of planes ready for takeoff.
10. Planes: Click on a plane in flight to view its details, such as altitude, speed, remaining fuel percentage, departure/arrival airports, and departure/arrival times.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is part of an academic assignment for undergraduate students pursuing a degree in computer science. It was developed as part of a university course, aimed at designing a real-time air traffic simulator. The goal was to apply theoretical concepts from software engineering, real-time systems, and computer graphics to create a functional and interactive simulation of air traffic management.
